	 *Static methods are declared using a static modifier 
	 *
	 *Static methods Cant's access instance methods and instance variables directly 
	 *
	 *They are usualy user for operation that dont require any data from an instance of the class(from this)
	 *
	 *the this keyword is the current instance of the class so, we cant use this keyword.
	 *
	 *Whenever you see a method that does not use instance variables that method should be declared as static method.
	 *
	 *for example main is a static method and it is called by jvm when it starts an application .
	 *
	 *Static methods are classed as ClassName.methodname() or methodname() is in the same class.
