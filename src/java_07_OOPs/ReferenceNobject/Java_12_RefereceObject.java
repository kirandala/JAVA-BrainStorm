	 * Analogy of building a house to understand class A class is basically a
	 * blueprint for a house, using the blueprint(Plans) we can build as many houses
	 * as we like based on the plans.
	 * 
	 * Each house you build ( in other words instantiate using the new operator) is
	 * an object also know as a instance.
	 * 
	 * Each house you build has an address(a physical location). In other words if
	 * you want to tell someone where you live, you give them your address (perhaps
	 * written one piece of paper). this is known as reference.
	 * 
	 * you can copy that reference as many times as you like but there is still
	 * just one house.In other words we are copying the paper that has address on it
	 * not the house itself
